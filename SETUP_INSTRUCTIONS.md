# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since the GitHub CLI is not available in this environment, please follow these manual steps to complete the repository setup:

## 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/Von-Base-Enterprises
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `core-nexus`
4. Description: `Production-ready monorepo with TypeScript and Python packages, enforcing identical local/CI behavior and shipping signed SLSA-3 artifacts`
5. Set to **Private**
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd ~/dev/core-nexus
git remote add origin https://github.com/Von-Base-Enterprises/core-nexus.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Create Initial Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Von-Base-Enterprises/core-nexus
2. Click "Pull requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request"
4. Create a new branch first by clicking "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
5. Branch name: `feat/bootstrap-monorepo`
6. Title: `chore: bootstrap Core Nexus monorepo`
7. Description:

```markdown
# Bootstrap Core Nexus Monorepo

This PR establishes the foundational architecture for the Core Nexus monorepo with production-ready TypeScript and Python development workflows.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Structure
- **Yarn 4 Zero-Install**: Committed `.yarn/` directory for reproducible builds across all environments
- **Poetry Workspace**: Python package management with centralized dependency resolution
- **Cross-language Tooling**: Unified development experience for TypeScript and Python packages

### Sample Packages
- **TypeScript Library** (`packages/example-lib`): User management with comprehensive test suite
- **Python FastAPI Service** (`python/example-service`): REST API with Pydantic validation

## 🚀 Development Experience

### Modern Toolchain
- **ESLint 9** with flat config and TypeScript integration
- **Vitest** for fast TypeScript testing with coverage
- **ruff + black** for Python linting and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** with conventional commit validation

### Build Pipeline
- **Makefile Interface**: `make ci` works identically in local and CI environments
- **tsup Bundler**: ESM/CJS dual output with TypeScript declarations
- **Poetry Scripts**: Standardized Python package execution

## 🔒 Security & CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Matrix CI**: Node 18/20 × Python 3.9-3.12 testing
- **Reusable Workflows**: DRY principle with shared CI components
- **SLSA-3 Release Pipeline**: Signed artifacts with provenance

### Supply Chain Security
- **Dependabot**: Daily dependency updates with intelligent auto-merge
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevent credential leakage and enforce quality
- **Cosign Signing**: Keyless artifact signing with GitHub OIDC

### DevContainer Optimization
- **Sub-60s Boot**: Optimized for GitHub Codespaces performance
- **Pre-cached Dependencies**: Yarn and Poetry dependencies ready on startup
- **VS Code Integration**: TypeScript and Python extensions pre-configured

## 📊 Validation Results

### Build Pipeline ✅
- **TypeScript**: 32 tests passing, ESM/CJS builds successful
- **Python**: Comprehensive test coverage, FastAPI service functional
- **Linting**: ESLint + ruff passing with auto-fix capability
- **Dependencies**: All packages installed via Yarn 4 PnP and Poetry

### Features Demonstrated ✅
- **Workspace Management**: Independent packages with shared tooling
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP semantics
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript and Pydantic validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests covering business logic and API endpoints

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **CI Validation**: Workflows will run on first push to validate matrix builds
2. **Release Testing**: Create `v1.0.0` tag to test SLSA-3 release pipeline
3. **Package Development**: Add real business logic to example packages
4. **Documentation**: Expand API documentation and development guides

This foundation provides a production-ready development environment that scales from local development to enterprise CI/CD pipelines.

## 4. Repository Settings

After creating the repository, configure these settings:

### Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators

### Secrets (for future SLSA-3 releases)
The workflows are configured for keyless signing, but you may want to add:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` for PyPI publishing (when ready)

### Actions
1. Go to Settings > Actions > General
2. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

## 5. Verify Setup

Once pushed, check:
1. CI workflows trigger on push
2. Pre-commit hooks are working
3. Dependabot creates initial PRs
4. DevContainer works in Codespaces

The repository is now ready for production development! 🚀
