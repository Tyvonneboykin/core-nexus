# âœ… Graph Deployment Checklist
## Quick Reference for Agent 1

### ðŸ”² Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Add graph dependencies to requirements.txt:
  ```
  spacy>=3.5.0
  asyncpg>=0.27.0
  ```
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL has graph tables (already in init-db.sql)
- [ ] Set `GRAPH_ENABLED=true` in environment (optional)

### ðŸ”² Deployment
- [ ] GraphProvider auto-initializes if dependencies present
- [ ] No code changes needed - already integrated
- [ ] Graph endpoints automatically available

### ðŸ”² Post-Deployment Verification  
- [ ] Check `/health` endpoint includes graph provider
- [ ] Test `/graph/stats` returns 200 OK
- [ ] Verify no performance degradation

### ðŸš¨ If Issues Arise
1. **Graph provider fails to init**: System continues without it (non-critical)
2. **spaCy model missing**: Falls back to regex patterns
3. **Performance impact**: Disable with `GRAPH_ENABLED=false`

### ðŸ“ž Graph-Specific Help
- Entity extraction issues â†’ Agent 2
- Core deployment issues â†’ Agent 1
- Database/infra issues â†’ Agent 1
- Graph algorithm issues â†’ Agent 2

**Remember**: Graph is an enhancement layer. Core service works perfectly without it!
