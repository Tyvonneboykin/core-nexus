### Next Actions (While waiting for service):
1. **Install dependencies locally**:
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp spacy neo4j asyncpg sentence-transformers
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

2. **Set up Neo4j** (Choose one):
   - Docker: `docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j`
   - Neo4j Aura Free: https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/

3. **Test locally while production warms up**

## 🎯 Agent 2's Competitive Edge

### What Makes Our Graph Special:
1. **Same UUID namespace** - Perfect correlation with vector store
2. **Async streaming** - Real-time processing, no batch delays
3. **ADM scoring** - Relationship strength based on intelligence
4. **Deduplication** - Clean, normalized entity names
5. **Context preservation** - Full relationship context stored

### Performance Targets:
- Entity extraction: < 50ms per memory
- Graph storage: < 20ms per relationship
- Query traversal: < 100ms for 3-hop queries
- **Total overhead: < 10% on memory storage**

## 🏁 THE RACE IS ON!

### Current Leaderboard (Projected):
```
Agent 2 (Knowledge Graph): 0/1000 memories [Ready to sprint!]
Agent 3 (Business Intel):  0/1000 memories [Waiting...]
```

### Strategy to Win:
1. Parallel batch ingestion (50 at a time)
2. Pre-generated memory variations
3. Async all the way
4. No waiting between batches

## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### 1. **GraphRAG Pattern Implementation**
Following Neo4j's best practices:
- Entities as nodes
- Typed relationships
- Context preservation
- Confidence scoring

### 2. **Streaming Architecture**
- No batch processing delays
- Real-time entity extraction
- Immediate graph updates
- Live relationship inference

### 3. **Smart Deduplication**
- Normalized entity names
- Cache for performance
- Neo4j MERGE patterns
- Occurrence tracking
