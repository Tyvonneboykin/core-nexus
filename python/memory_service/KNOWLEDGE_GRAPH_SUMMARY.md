# Knowledge Graph Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The Knowledge Graph Provider has been fully implemented and integrated into Core Nexus Memory Service. The implementation is complete but **currently disabled** for production stability.

### Database Layer (init-db.sql)
- Added `graph_nodes` table for entity storage
- Added `graph_relationships` table for connections  
- Added `memory_entity_map` for correlation
- Created performance indexes and helper functions

### Model Layer (models.py)
- EntityType and RelationshipType enums
- GraphNode and GraphRelationship models
- EntityExtraction and GraphQuery models
- Complete data validation with Pydantic

### Provider Layer (providers.py)
- Full GraphProvider implementation (lines 543-987)
- Entity extraction with spaCy and regex fallback
- Relationship inference based on co-occurrence
- ADM scoring integration
- Lazy async pool initialization

### API Layer (api.py)  
- 7 graph-specific endpoints added
- GraphProvider initialization code (disabled)
- Full integration with existing patterns

### Dependencies (requirements.txt)
- Added spacy>=3.5.0 for entity extraction

## Production Safety Measures

1. **Disabled by Default**: GraphProvider initialization is commented out
2. **Non-Breaking**: System operates normally without it
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to regex if spaCy unavailable
4. **Lazy Initialization**: Prevents async conflicts

## How to Enable

When ready to activate:
```python
# In api.py, uncomment lines 127-129
# The connection string is already built from pgvector config
```

## Verification

The implementation has been tested locally and is ready for gradual rollout once core service stability is confirmed.
