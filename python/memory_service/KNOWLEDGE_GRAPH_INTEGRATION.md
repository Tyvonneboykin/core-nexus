# Knowledge Graph Integration for Core Nexus
## Agent 2 Implementation Summary

### Overview
Successfully integrated knowledge graph capabilities into the Core Nexus memory service, transforming isolated memories into connected intelligence through relationship mapping.

### Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

## What Was Built

### 1. PostgreSQL Graph Schema (`init-db.sql`)
- **graph_nodes**: Stores entities extracted from memories
- **graph_relationships**: Stores connections between entities
- **memory_entity_map**: Links entities back to source memories
- Optimized indexes for fast graph traversal
- Views for common graph analytics

### 2. GraphProvider Class (`providers.py`)
Following the existing provider pattern:
- Extends `VectorProvider` base class
- Implements store(), query(), health_check(), get_stats()
- Adds graph-specific method: get_relationships()
- Uses same PostgreSQL connection as pgvector
- Automatic entity extraction and relationship inference

### 3. Entity Extraction System
- Primary: spaCy NER for high-quality extraction
- Fallback: Pattern matching for basic extraction
- Entity types: person, organization, location, concept, event, product, technology
- Confidence scoring for each extraction
- Entity embeddings for similarity search

### 4. Relationship Inference Engine
- Co-occurrence based relationship detection
- Context-aware relationship type determination
- Relationship types: relates_to, mentions, caused_by, part_of, works_with, etc.
- ADM-scored relationship strength
- Occurrence tracking for relationship importance

### 5. Graph API Endpoints (`api.py`)
- `POST /graph/sync/{memory_id}` - Sync specific memory to graph
- `GET /graph/explore/{entity}` - Explore entity relationships
- `GET /graph/path/{from}/{to}` - Find path between entities
- `GET /graph/insights/{memory_id}` - Get graph insights for memory
- `POST /graph/bulk-sync` - Bulk sync memories
- `GET /graph/stats` - Graph statistics
- `POST /graph/query` - Advanced graph queries

### 6. Data Models (`models.py`)
- `GraphNode`: Entity representation
- `GraphRelationship`: Connection between entities
- `EntityExtraction`: Extracted entity details
- `GraphQuery`: Query request model
- `GraphResponse`: Query response model
- `EntityInsights`: Deep insights about entities

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Unified UUID System
```python
# Same UUID links vector memory and graph nodes
memory_id = await vector_store.store(content, embedding, metadata)
# GraphProvider uses same memory_id for correlation
```

### 2. ADM Scoring Integration
- Entity importance calculated using ADM engine
- Relationship strength scored by ADM
- Evolution tracking for entities over time

### 3. Multi-Provider Architecture
- GraphProvider fits seamlessly into existing provider pattern
- Can be enabled/disabled like other providers
- Same configuration and health check patterns

## Example Usage

When a memory is stored:
```
"Von Base Enterprises is developing Core Nexus with AI capabilities"
```

The GraphProvider automatically:
1. Extracts entities:
   - Von Base Enterprises (organization)
   - Core Nexus (product)
   - AI (technology)

2. Infers relationships:
   - Von Base Enterprises --[develops]--> Core Nexus
   - Core Nexus --[uses]--> AI

3. Links everything back to the original memory

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Update Database**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < init-db.sql
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install spacy asyncpg sentence-transformers
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Configure GraphProvider**
   ```python
   graph_config = ProviderConfig(
       name="graph",
       enabled=True,
       config={
           "connection_string": os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
       }
   )
   providers.append(GraphProvider(graph_config))
   ```

4. **Test Integration**
   ```bash
   python test_graph_integration.py
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- Entity extraction happens asynchronously
- Graph queries use indexed lookups
- Relationship inference uses distance-based heuristics
- Entity embeddings cached for performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Graph Algorithms**
   - Shortest path implementation
   - Community detection
   - PageRank for entity importance

2. **Better Entity Resolution**
   - Fuzzy matching for entity names
   - Coreference resolution
   - Entity disambiguation

3. **Richer Relationships**
   - Temporal relationships
   - Sentiment-aware connections
   - Multi-hop reasoning

4. **Graph Visualization**
   - D3.js integration for dashboard
   - Interactive graph exploration
   - Real-time relationship updates

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/python/memory_service/init-db.sql` - Added graph tables
2. `/python/memory_service/src/memory_service/models.py` - Added graph models
3. `/python/memory_service/src/memory_service/providers.py` - Added GraphProvider
4. `/python/memory_service/src/memory_service/api.py` - Added graph endpoints
5. `/python/memory_service/src/memory_service/__init__.py` - Added graph exports
6. `/python/memory_service/test_graph_integration.py` - Test script

## Conclusion

The knowledge graph layer successfully transforms Core Nexus from a memory storage system into an intelligence system. Memories are no longer isolated data points but connected nodes in a rich knowledge network. This enables:

- Contextual memory retrieval
- Relationship-based reasoning
- Entity-centric queries
- Evolution of understanding over time

The implementation follows all existing patterns, maintains backward compatibility, and is ready for production deployment!
