## üîÑ PR Structure

### Title
```
feat: Add Knowledge Graph Provider for connected intelligence
```

### Description
```markdown
## Summary
This PR introduces the Knowledge Graph Provider to Core Nexus, enabling automatic extraction of entities and relationships from memories to create a connected intelligence layer.

## What's New
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically extracts people, organizations, technologies, and concepts from memory content
- **Relationship Inference**: Discovers connections between entities based on context and co-occurrence
- **ADM Integration**: Uses Darwin-G√∂del scoring for relationship strength
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Leverages existing PostgreSQL infrastructure with new graph tables
- **7 New API Endpoints**: Complete graph query and exploration capabilities

## Implementation Details
- Follows existing provider architecture pattern
- Non-breaking: system works without graph provider
- Graceful degradation: falls back to regex if spaCy unavailable
- Lazy initialization: prevents async conflicts during startup
- Same UUID namespace: perfect correlation with vector memories

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Database schema complete
- ‚úÖ Models defined
- ‚úÖ GraphProvider implemented
- ‚úÖ API endpoints ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Provider initialization disabled in API startup (line 117-118)

The GraphProvider is fully implemented but temporarily disabled in the API startup to ensure stable deployment. Once the core service is stable, simply set `GRAPH_ENABLED=true` to activate.

## Testing
- Local testing scripts included but not committed
- Comprehensive verification performed
- No blocking issues found

## Next Steps
1. Deploy with GraphProvider disabled
2. Verify core service stability
3. Enable GraphProvider with environment variable
4. Run entity extraction on existing memories

## Related Issues
- Addresses need for relationship understanding in memories
- Enables future features like semantic search and knowledge discovery

## üöÄ Execution Steps

1. **Check current branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   # Should be: feat/day1-vertical-slice
   ```

2. **Create new branch for PR**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/knowledge-graph-integration
   ```

3. **Stage and commit files**:
   ```bash
   # Commit 1: Database
   git add init-db.sql
   git commit -m "feat(db): Add PostgreSQL schema for knowledge graph"

   # Commit 2: Models
   git add src/memory_service/models.py
   git commit -m "feat(models): Add data models for knowledge graph functionality"

   # Commit 3: Provider
   git add src/memory_service/providers.py
   git commit -m "feat(providers): Implement GraphProvider for knowledge graph"

   # Commit 4: API (disabled)
   git add src/memory_service/api.py
   git commit -m "feat(api): Add knowledge graph API endpoints (disabled)"

   # Commit 5: Dependencies
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "feat(deps): Add spaCy dependency for entity extraction"
   ```

4. **Push branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/knowledge-graph-integration
   ```

5. **Create PR on GitHub**:
   - Base: `main` or `develop` (check repo structure)
   - Compare: `feat/knowledge-graph-integration`
   - Use the PR description template above

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **GraphProvider is disabled**: Line 117-118 in api.py shows it's disabled for stability
2. **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality unchanged
3. **Clean commit history**: 5 logical commits showing progression
4. **Documentation**: Extensive but not committed (can share separately)
