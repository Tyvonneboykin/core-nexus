# üìä PRODUCTION DATA STATUS REPORT

## ‚úÖ DATA IS SAFE - NO DATA LOSS!

### Actual Data Status:
- **pgvector**: 1,008 memories ‚úÖ
- **chromadb**: 1 memory ‚úÖ  
- **graph**: 77 nodes, 27 relationships ‚úÖ

### The Problem:
The `/memories/stats` endpoint shows 0 for providers because:
1. Old code is still running (deployment pending)
2. Stats calculation was fixed but not deployed yet
3. Health endpoint shows correct data

## EVIDENCE:

### 1. Health Endpoint (CORRECT) ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "pgvector": {
    "total_vectors": 1008,
    "status": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### 2. Stats Endpoint (BROKEN - OLD CODE) ‚ùå
```json
{
  "total_memories": 3,
  "memories_by_provider": {
    "pgvector": 0,  // Wrong!
    "chromadb": 0,  // Wrong!
    "graph": 0      // Wrong!
  }
}
```

### 3. Query Results (WORKING) ‚úÖ
- Search returns results
- Found 10 memories for "test" query
- Data is accessible

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS

Two fixes are pending deployment:
1. **Query fix**: Allow empty queries (deployed ~5 mins ago)
2. **Stats fix**: Show correct counts (deployed ~10 mins ago)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### For Customer:
Tell them:
- **Data is SAFE** - all 1,008 memories are in the database
- Stats display bug will be fixed when deployment completes
- Queries are working and returning data
- No action needed - just wait for deployment

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check real data (health endpoint)
curl https://core-nexus-memory-service.onrender.com/health | jq '.providers.pgvector.details'

# Once deployed, stats will show correctly
curl https://core-nexus-memory-service.onrender.com/memories/stats
```

## SUMMARY

**NO DATA LOSS** - This is a display bug in the stats endpoint. The deployment in progress will fix:
1. Stats showing correct counts
2. Empty queries working
3. Trust metrics in responses

ETA: Should be deployed within next 5-10 minutes.
