# Enterprise Deduplication PR Review Checklist

## Code Review Checklist

### ✅ Database Changes (`init-db.sql`)
- [ ] New tables don't conflict with existing schema
- [ ] Indexes are appropriate for query patterns
- [ ] Triggers won't impact performance
- [ ] Partitioning strategy for metrics table

### ✅ Core Implementation (`deduplication.py`)
- [ ] SHA-256 hashing implementation is correct
- [ ] Vector similarity threshold is configurable
- [ ] Business rules are extensible
- [ ] Error handling fails gracefully
- [ ] Metrics collection is efficient

### ✅ Integration (`unified_store.py`)
- [ ] Deduplication check happens before expensive operations
- [ ] Feature flag controls work correctly
- [ ] Statistics are tracked accurately
- [ ] No impact when deduplication is OFF

### ✅ API Endpoints (`api.py`)
- [ ] Admin endpoints are properly secured
- [ ] Error responses are informative
- [ ] Backfill operation is idempotent
- [ ] Stats endpoint provides useful metrics

### ✅ Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- [ ] Default mode is OFF for safety
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] Admin key is not hardcoded

## Testing Verification

- [ ] Test script runs successfully
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance impact < 5ms

## Deployment Safety

- [ ] Feature is OFF by default
- [ ] Can be enabled/disabled without restart
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented
- [ ] Monitoring endpoints work

## Documentation

- [ ] Deployment guide is complete
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Configuration options explained
- [ ] Metrics interpretation guide

## Performance Validation

- [ ] Content hashing < 2ms
- [ ] Database queries use indexes
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Memory usage is bounded

## Security Review

- [ ] Admin endpoints require authentication
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Hash collisions handled safely
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
