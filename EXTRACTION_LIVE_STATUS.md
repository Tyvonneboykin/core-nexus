# üî¥ LIVE: Entity Extraction in Progress

## Current Status: ACTIVELY RUNNING

**Process ID**: 24009  
**Start Time**: 2025-06-09T12:05:00  
**Current Time**: 2025-06-09T12:08:00  
**Elapsed**: ~3 minutes  

## Progress So Far

### ‚úÖ Batch 1/7 - COMPLETE
- Memories: 150
- Entities Found: 18
- Relationships: 16
- Time: 7.19 seconds
- Status: SUCCESS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch 2/7 - COMPLETE (with warning)
- Memories: 150
- Result: JSON parsing failed
- Status: HANDLED (continued processing)

### üîÑ Batch 3/7 - IN PROGRESS
- Currently waiting or processing...

### ‚è≥ Remaining: 4 more batches

## Estimated Completion

- **Total Batches**: 7
- **Time per Batch**: ~75 seconds (10s processing + 65s wait)
- **Total Time**: ~9 minutes
- **Expected Completion**: ~12:14 PM

## What's Happening

The robust extraction pipeline is:
1. Processing 150 memories at a time
2. Extracting entities and relationships using Gemini AI
3. Waiting 65 seconds between batches (rate limiting)
4. Handling errors gracefully (Batch 2 had JSON issue but continued)

## Live Monitoring

To watch the progress in real-time:
```bash
tail -f extraction_output.log
```

To check if still running:
```bash
ps -p 24009
```

## Expected Outcomes

When complete:
- **File Created**: `robust_extraction_results.json`
- **Database Updated**: New entities and relationships inserted
- **Total Entities**: 50-100+ unique entities expected
- **Total Relationships**: 100+ connections expected

## Next Steps

Once extraction completes:
1. Review `robust_extraction_results.json`
2. Check database for new entities
3. Verify graph population
4. Test entity queries
